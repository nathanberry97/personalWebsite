# Personal development environment

```
My personal development environment is better than yours
```

I've come to realise that majority of people I've worked with don't really
care much for their personal development setup, just download vscode and jobs
a goodun.
But I believe people can get a much better experience if they just put a little
more effort into the tools they use.

To be fair I probably spend too much time thinking about the developer tools I
use, and how they work together.
I get neovim isn't for everyone but I'm going to be writing this posts in hopes
to inspire you on revamping your development environment.
