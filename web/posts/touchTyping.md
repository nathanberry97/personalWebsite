# Touch typing

Being comfortable at the computer

As of late I've seen a few comments flying around not needing to learn how to
touch type, even if your job is on a computer.
Usually it revolves around the idea of "I need to think more than needing to
type", or some other excuse to be honest they aren't very convincing.
If you are on the fence about learning to touch type my hope is this post
will give you the push to invest the time needed to learn this skill.

A bit of background on myself I only started to learn how to touch type back
in 2020, not that I gave it too much thought before that if I'm being honest.
I was quite use to just using my hunt and peck technique I learnt over the
years.
As you could probably guess I wasn't very proficient on the keyboard, but I
never really saw it as an issue.

But that all changed in 2020, I wanted to be able to use the computer while
not having to look at my keyboard every time I tried to type anything.
So I started learning on [typeing.com](https://www.typing.com/en-gb/student/lessons)
and then I got quite into trying to increase my typing speed on
[ten fast fingers](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english).
As of late if I ever want to do any practising I now only use
[monkey type](https://monkeytype.com/), I think it is probably one of the
better sites to practice your touch typing on.

Since then I've picked up using vim for all my notes and enable vim keybindings
on any application which allows me.
Which I know pre 2020 Nathan would struggle with and probably think using
vim keybindings is a massive waste of time, why else did they invent the mouse?
But I wouldn't have been more wrong.
As it helps me to be able to iterate on my ideas more easily, to navigate
text files without thought, and just makes the experience of working on the
computer more enjoyable.

What I'm getting at is that learning how to touch type correctly makes using
the computer more enjoyable, and if you are on a computer 40 hours or more a
week why wouldn't you want to?
If you are on the fence about investing the time learning how to touch type
just do it as Shia LaBeouf would say.
