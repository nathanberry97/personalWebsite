### Reflecting on 2025

It has come to that time of year again where I'm able to look back and reflect
on how the year went, then make some vague goals for the up coming year.

One of the biggest changes during 2025 for myself was getting a new job.
Which is surprising as if you went on any form of social media this year you
would think skynet would be taking your job.
But at the start of the year I started interviewing with a few different places
and ended up at
[GDS](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service).
I started the role in November, I know people said things were
slow at the government but I didn't realise this meant with the recruitment
too aha!

I also managed to finish a personal project called
[rss2go](https://github.com/nathanberry97/rss2go)
which is a self-hosted RSS Feed aggregator.
I use this application everyday now to keep on top of news feeds I want to
follow.
The reason for creating rss2go was due to deleting all forms of social media,
with the only platform I'm still on being LinkedIn.
So I needed some way to keep up to date, but then again with how social media
is in 2025 you could argue it is a poor way to keep up to date.

Another thing I'm happy I've been able to do throughout 2025 was to produce one
blog post a month.
Which looking back at the previous two years of owning this site is a quite
impressive improvement.
I do plan on creating more content for this site next year but more on that in
the next section.

In terms of fitness goals this year I just about managed to complete my first
marathon.
Not the sub four hours I would have liked, but I'm glad I was able to complete
the race.
There is always next marathon season, I'll be aiming for sub four this time
around.

### Goals for 2026

This year I want to focus on getting certifications which I hope will help to
improve the quality of work I produce.
With the two certifications I am most interested in sitting being AWS Solutions
Architect Professional and Red Hat Certified Engineer.
Admittedly this will probably be quite a lot to do along side a full time job
and not wanting to be on my computer past 5:30pm.
But with the deep work habits I've built up through 2025 I believe this to be
an achievable goal.

Also in terms of personal projects I want to finish up my playdate game and
release it on [itch.io](https://itch.io/).
Along side wanting to create a tui application which replicates
[postman](https://www.postman.com/),
mainly due to wanting some stateful way of running commands against APIs rather
than using __curl__.
In terms of when I'm going to make the time to work on these projects I'll be
focusing on them during the weekends.

With blogging I am still going to be doing one blog post a month but I am also
going to be writing about the books I read during the month.
Mainly as a way to be able to reflect on each of the books, along side helping
me to keep track of the 30 books I want to read.
I'll probably have square eyes at the start of 2027 if I am able to stick to
this goal.

Lastly in terms of my fitness goals this year I am going to be running another
marathon in April.
With the target being sub four hours, if I don't do it this time around there
will always be next year.
But I feel pretty confident on this target, as I know what to expect coming
into the race compared to my previous marathon.

I think that is probably enough to keep me busy for another year, be sure to
come back to the blog in 2027 to see how I did with my goals...
