# Saying goodbye to google

```
Taking back my privacy
```

Recently I decide I wanted to move away from using google products and
big tech in general.
Many people do this for different reasons, for myself it was mainly not wanting
to support monopolies and concerns of my digital privacy.

Some of you may have come across the term "degoogling", which is
reference to actively changing the products you use based on what you value
rather than using what is easiest.
For many people they don't mind using the most convenient service, but this post
is going to be around how I managed my break up with big tech.

To start with one of my favourite companies I started using to replace googles
offerings is [proton](https://proton.me/).
This is due to their stance on privacy first, ensuring my data stays private.
Basically I've replace the google suite with protons offerings, I've been using
them for the past month or so and I don't have any complaints as of yet.

In terms of how I navigate the internet I still use FireFox and have been a
FireFox user for as long as I can remember.
But I've now updated my search engine to DuckDuckGo, I've been using this
search engine for quite a while now and much prefer it over google.

Admittedly this has been a quick overview of how I'm making a more deliberate
choice in the tools I use.
To be honest I didn't use too many services to begin with, along side not
having social media it was quite easy for myself to make the switch.
Hopefully this post has made you more aware of the tools you are using and
perhaps how you can migrate to other offerings.
