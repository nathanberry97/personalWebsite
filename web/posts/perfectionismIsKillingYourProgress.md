```
What is worse than buggy side project?
A side project which is still in your head
```

I like many others developers get nervous when having my code out there in the
public domain, what if someone reads the source code and thinks I'm a terrible
developer?
News flash no one will and even if they did I don't think you should care about
their opinions.

Remember you are the one who decides if a side project is successful or not,
don't worry if you're the only user.
As with many of my side projects I'm the only user, if you have an idea and
you think it would be useful create it.

For example
[dumbtab](https://github.com/nathanberry97/dumbtab.nvim),
my [personal blog](https://github.com/nathanberry97/personalWebsite),
and [rss2go](https://github.com/nathanberry97/rss2go)
to name a few are projects I created which I wanted to use.
Do I look at some of the code and think god who wrote that, of course but that
is a sign that I am growing as a developer.

I remember a few years ago thinking that I'll get judged by my peers but most
of them don't care.
Your biggest critic is yourself, you just have to ignore any self doubts you
may have and just start creating.
You have to start somewhere, so if that is a silly little tui app you have
in mind or even a SaaS all I have to say is best of luck.
