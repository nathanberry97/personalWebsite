This page is intended for my work colleagues as a manual of me, so if you
aren't a work colleague read on if you want to know my working habits...
I'm currently working at the GDS as a Software Engineer on the GOV.UK Once
program focusing on [FLEX](https://github.com/govuk-once/flex), as far as I can
tell it was named solely for the use of the flex emoji 💪.

### Conditions I like to work in

```
* I enjoy working with headphones on, usually listening to some form of jazz

* My preferred way of work is via the terminal with tmux

* Dislike using anything which doesn't support vim key bindings

* Enjoy long time blocks to focus on a single task
```

### The hours I like to work

```
* Winter hours tend to be 09:00 - 17:00

* Summer hours tend to be 08:00 - 16:00

* I will be available between 09:00 - 16:00 all year round
```

### The best ways to communicate with me

```
* Via slack as I'm usually not the best getting back to emails

* If something takes more than one message to sort out I prefer arranging a call

* I prefer to organise calls asynchronously rather than being called out of the blue
```

### The ways I like to receive feedback

```
* Feel free to message me via slack or email for feedback positive or negative

* Or if you prefer you can always organise a call
```

### Things I need

```
* Clear communication

* Good team dynamics

* Not to take everything too seriously
```

### Things I struggle with

```
* I tend to disable notifications so I'm sometimes not the most timely at responding

* Multitasking, if you say you're good at multitasking I won't believe you
```

### Things I love

```
* Improving my developer workflow

* Keyboards, I quite like building and tinkering with them

* Learning and immersing myself with new things
```

### Other things to know about me

```
* I'm quite a keen runner

* I enjoy reading fiction and non-fiction
```
