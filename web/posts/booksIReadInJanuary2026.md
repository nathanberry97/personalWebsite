# Books I read in January 2026

Books I've read throughout January 2026
```

This month I somehow managed to get through 5 books, admittedly some were
quite small.
But nevertheless I still read 5 books, so without further ado here are the
books I read in chronological order.

### The Thursday Murder Club

The first book I read this month was The Thursday Murder Club.
I did watch the movie on Netflix when it came out, which made me want to get
into this series.
If I'm being honest I quite enjoyed it, admittedly it was basically the same
as the movie, but it was quite nice reading how the main group interact with
each other.
As quite a lot of the time you don't really get to read about people who are
in their seventies.

### A Study in Scarlet

The second book I read this month was A Study in Scarlet the first of the
Sherlock Holmes series.
This is quite a short read but I felt like it was a good length and who doesn't
love a good revenge story.
I quite liked the second half of the book when it was based in America.

### The God Delusion

The first and only non fiction book I read this month was The God
Delusion.
When reading the book it was confirming all my biases as I've always been an
atheist.
I quite liked the concept of consciousness raising which is referred to throughout
the book.

### Animal Farm

Now this is a classic and I think most people should read this if they haven't.
I first read Animal Farm many years ago and think it is one of my favourite
books by George Orwell.
The main reason I reread this book is due to rereading Brace New World and
1984 last year and it made me want to revisit this book.
One of my favourite quotes from the book is "All animals are equal,
but some animals are more equal than others".

### The Man Who Died Twice

The last book I read in January is the second book in The Thursday Murder Club,
I think it is more enjoyable than the first.
But that is probably because I didn't know what was going to happen throughout
the story due to there being no movie for it.
I'm quite liking this series and looking forward to reading the next couple of
novels within the series.

### Closing Thoughts

That is all the books I've read throughout the month and think I've made
a good start to the year.
Looking forward to the books I'll be reading this month, there may be a few
more non fiction and I would be surprised if I don't at least read the 3rd
book in The Thursday Murder Club.
