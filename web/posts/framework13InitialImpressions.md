# Framework 13: Initial Impressions

## 2025-05-05

```
Repairability has never been so easy
```

It has finally arrived, after pre-ordering my framework 13 at the start of
March I finally got my hands on it.
So far the laptop has been everything I wanted in a computer for on the go.
In terms of laptops I am coming from a Macbook Pro 13 M1 which I purchased back
in 2020.

The main reason I purchased the Framework 13 is due to wanting to use Linux on
my laptop and their first class repairability.
Also on my PC I use Fedora and I always find it a pain managing the
configuration of each of my computers, which always results in one of the
computers using some outdated configuration: First world problems.

Since pre-ordering my laptop I decided to create a new repo to setup and
install all the software I use on Fedora, for anyone interested it is
[here](https://github.com/nathanberry97/berryora).
This repo now configures both my laptop and PC which is a great experience for
myself as this reduces the amount of overhead dramatically.

The specs for the machine are the following:
Ryzen 7 350,
2.8k Screen,
blank ansi keyboard,
black transparent bezel,
32GB ram,
and 1TB storage.
If you're curious of what the laptop looks like with the blank keyboard and
black transparent bezel here is a photo:

Now I've had the Framework 13 for a few days there aren't any complaints,
as the main thing I do on my computers is development work.
All of my code is done within neovim which this computer handles with ease,
the laptop has been quiet, and the battery life so far has been great.
Plus I much prefer the workflow of my linux setup rather than any other
operating system.

If you are on the fence about purchasing the Framework 13 I highly recommend
the laptop, but that might be because they offer blank keycaps and transparent
bezels...
