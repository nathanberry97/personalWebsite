# Make time for depth

## 2025-12-23

```
To work deeply on something you need to make time for it
```

It has come to that time of year again where I reflect on what went well.
One area which sticks out when looking back on the year is making time for
depth.

Before I continue I'll define what I mean by depth: depth is where I
am able to focus uninterrupted on a single task.
This is how I was able to do most of my side projects such as
[rss2go](https://github.com/nathanberry97/rss2go).

Admittedly throughout the year there has been peaks and troughs of where I have
been able to make time for depth.
But when reflecting on this in my journals I've noticed the months I've been
most productive I made time for depth.

How I like to add depth into my life is through sessions in the morning,
usually between 60-90 minutes.
The important thing is being consistent with these sessions.
As having 4 deep sessions a week is much better than spending all of Sunday
working deeply.

The reason for making these sessions in the morning is that willpower is a
finite resource.
A good way to view willpower is like a muscle, the more you use it throughout
the day the more it depletes.
After work it will be harder to work on your side project compared to if you
do it in the morning.

So as we head towards the new year one thing I'll be focusing on is making
more time for depth.
As I have some personal goals I want to achieve throughout the next year which
will require deep uninterrupted focus.
