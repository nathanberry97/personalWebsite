I've finally got around to implementing the blog feature of my website; or I've
written this post and it is living on my hard drive somewhere. Let's hope it is
the former rather than the latter.

Why the hell do I want to start a blog? In all seriousness I thought it would
be a good way to write about my current thoughts around all things technology.

In terms of the content I'll be focusing on software and hardware such as;
developer workflow, coding projects, keyboards, PC builds.

Anyway that is all for now and I hope to be seeing you on my next blog post.
