# Year in review 2023

### 2024-01-01


```
Some of the bits and bobs I've muddled through during the past year and goals I want to achieve during 2024
```

I'm writing this blog post to reflect on my 2023 accomplishments and
and what I want to achieve in 2024.
I hope that others will find this blog post interesting and that it will
inspire them to do the same. I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep up with
writing a yearly review every year, but I'll try my best.

## Achievements - 2023

At the start of the year I worked on converting my website from being
published on GitHub Pages to being hosted through AWS. I also
implemented a blog feature on my website, which I've been meaning to do
for a while.
Here is a link to the [source code](https://github.com/nathanberry97/personalWebsite)
for anyone who is interested.

I finally got around to getting
[Red Hat Certified System Administrator](https://www.credly.com/badges/72e86e8c-3fb1-493d-97e4-28f0c5845ce5/public_url).
Which was a goal I set for myself in 2022, I think this certification
is a great way to understand the basics of Linux through the terminal.

I developed some games using Python and Pygame;
[Snake](https://github.com/nathanberry97/PySnake) clone and a
[Space Invaders](https://github.com/nathanberry97/PyInvaders) clone.
This got me interested in game development; an interest which I'll be
taking into 2024.

I made a Neovim plugin [dumbtab.nvim](https://github.com/nathanberry97/dumbtab.nvim),
which adds tab line functionality to Neovim, something I wanted to do for a
while. The aim was to have tab line functionality which I could customise to my
liking. [Click here](./creatingYourFirstNeovimPlugin.html) to read my earlier
blog post on this topic.

I created [nasaImageOfTheDay](https://github.com/nathanberry97/nasaImageOfTheDay)
which is a project using docker and AWS. This container
downloads the NASA image of the day and sends a texts to my phone using Twilio.
This then evolved into the [APOD](../apod.html) page on my website.

## Goals - 2024

I want to create a TUI application using Go, which will be a
RSS reader. I've been using [nom](https://github.com/guyfedwards/nom)
for a while now and I think it would be fun to create my own.

Continuing on from the game development I did in 2023, I want to
create a game for the [Playdate](https://play.date/). I have a few
ideas of stuff I want to develop, plus creating a game for a physical
GameBoy-like device would be healing my inner child.

For certifications I would like to start studying towards the
[AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/).
Mainly because my Associate certification will expire in 2025 and I need to put
my 50% off voucher to good use.

Also I want to create a file tree explorer for Neovim, which will
enhance [Netrw](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1075)
and make it more user friendly. I've been using the built in file tree explorer
for a while now and I think it would be fun to extend the functionality of it.

I would like to study Algorithms and Data Structures, after attempting
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in 2023. I realised that it's
been a while since I've studied them. I think it would be good to shake off the
cobwebs and refresh my memory.

Lastly in terms of my blog, I would like to write at least one blog post
a month, as I want document my journey and share my knowledge with others.
